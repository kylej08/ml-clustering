## Note
Due to this project being part of the HyperionDev bootcamp, the source code is available in a private repository.

# An overview

## A description of how it works
A program that utilises the k-means algorithm in order to converge a set of data.

The data is within excel files. One from 1953, and the other from 2008. It contains three columns, one being the country, the next being the birth rate per 1000, and the last is the life expectancy.

## The purpose
The goal of this program was to understand how to use the k-means algorithm in order to cluster and converge data.
